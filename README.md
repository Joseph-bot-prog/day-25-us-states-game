Day-25

Use your imagination to figure things out. Today's topics were CSV, and Pandas Library in Python, which was wonderfully explained by Angela Yu

What did I learn?

CSV package.
Pandas library: read_csv()
Series and Data Frame
Project of the day
Guess the state using Pandas Library. You can check out my code. You can also clone and run on a local machine using an IDE.

Conclusion
To conclude, I would thank my instructor for being such a wonderful teacher and for coming up with a beautiful course. I would like to thank MYSELF for being self-motivated throughout the lecture.

Suggestion

All those who can understand English at a fast pace and catch up with what the instructor is trying to convey can choose to watch the video at 1.2x speed which reduces the watch time and meanwhile, you can keep the remaining time for practice.
